	 increased message buffer size

1/13/16, 3:35 PM: Outline login/Account system

1/14/17, 4:30 pm: finished the login/Account system. Not tested.

1/15/17, 12:39 AM: attempted to debug login/account system, code was littered with issues and errors. - Julius
	 Fixed:
		makefile
		header files and inclusion
		syntax errors
		compiler errors
		minor UI errors		

	 Changed:
		
		accounts.c
		accounts.h
		fserver.c
		fserver.h
		client.c

		method by which we open and read a file and strsep through it (fixed but not tested as the program would not advance)
		       affects: check_repeated_username(), login()
		commented out main() of client.c during testing, did not uncomment
		touched users.csv, did not look into interactivity with it (not tested as the program would not advance)

	 Problems that persist:
	     	issues with connection between components
		check_repeated_username does not complete fopen nor does it trigger error: Steven I think youre using fopen incorrectly
		the user interface is not displayed client-side, is displayed server-side (!!!)

	 Most of my time was devoted to fixing the syntax and compiler errors, only made minor progress with actual new code
